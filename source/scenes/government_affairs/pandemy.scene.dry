Epidemy of typhus ravages the land of Western Ukraine. With the destructions on unseend scale during the Great War fighting, there is nearly no Hospitals left. 
subtittle: [? If equipment <= 3 : "For the first time in Ukraine, after 12 years of military and military practice, I had to see an armed rifleman, who was on duty barefoot" â€” Osyp Levytskyi. Our lack of quality and quantity of equipment worsens the pandemic. We need to solve the issue fast. ?] 
subtitle: [?If medics <= 100 : Our lack of military medics as well as doctors puts a serious strain on our handling of epidemy ?] 

- @Hire_medics: By hiring new medics we can prevent the most harmful consequences of the epidemy
- @building_the_hospitals: Expand our hospital beds space, restore destroyed hospitals and open new military hospitals
- @root: Take no action for now.

As with the Prussian state police, there are measures we can take to root out reactionary and anti-democratic sentiment in the police. We can improve training and recruiting procedures, and identify and remove known fascists and the like.

Corruption in big business is rampant, of course. We have uncovered a number of scandals, and publicizing them brings new attention to the work of Interior Minister [+ interior_minister +], building up his popular appeal and that of the SPD.

Unfortunately, our investigations have failed to turn up anything. Rumors are that the targets of our investigation were tipped off by infiltrators within the police.

[? if investigate_far_right == 1 : We have discovered collusion between Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, and the Nazis. This is very useful information. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right == 2 : We have discovered illegal arms smuggling by the SA, the Nazi paramilitary. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right == 3 : We have discovered a secret cache of documents from the NSDAP detailing their plan to violently take over the country if they enter into power. This is an anti-constitutional plot, and will be publicized and persecuted. ?]
[? if investigate_far_right > 3 : Of course the Nazis are doing crimes; everyone knows that. Now, we finally have proof. ?]
