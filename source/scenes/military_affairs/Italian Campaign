= Italian Campaign

The Great War still ongoing, but it seems that Central Power wouldnt stay. Austria-Hungarian state is already in the process of disentegration. We could use this moment to ensure transportation of our forces in Austro-Hungarian army from battlegrounds of Italy to Ukraine.
It is important to note, that not only volunteers, but mobilized Ukrainian soldiers in Austro-Hungarian army. We could try to use our influence to return as much soldiers in Ukraine as fast as possible. 

- @Secret_deal: By using our "contacts" in Austro-Hungary we could try to secretly transport Ukrainian troops from the frontline. 
- @approach_austria: We are sure that Austro-Hungarian state wouldn't compromise on mobilized soldiers. However, with proper diplomacy we could get back Ukrainian volunteers of Sich Riflemen.
- @switch_sides: Vasyl Paneiko, editor of daily newspaper "Dilo", now discussed to be first minister of Foreign Affairs of Western Ukrainian State, secretly proposes a formation of Galician legion on the side of the Entente from Ukrainian prisoners... Maybe we should "switch sides"?
- @negotiate_with_Austria: We could negotiate with Austro-Hungarian state to help us with resources, and commit loyally to the Austro-Hungary. It could be the right thing to do.
