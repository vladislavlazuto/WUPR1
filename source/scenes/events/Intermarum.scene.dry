After a long struggle for liberty and independence, Eastern Europe finally free. Newly formed, arisen or reformed states of the region, through the common struggle, are moving towards political union. <b>Hungarian Republic, Czecho-Slovakia, Ukrainian People's Republic, Belarus People's Republic, Kuban People's Republic, Crimean Democratic Republic, Polish Republic, Latvian, Lithuaniand and Estonian Republics</b> are all signed the preliminary agreements. Additional discussions are held with Finland, Austria, Georgia, Bulgaria and Armenia. 
Our new political union faces many dangers, Bolshevist incursion still continues, and German geopolitical orientation still undecided. However, now, with the new nations bonding together, our future promises to be bright.
